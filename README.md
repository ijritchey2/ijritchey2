- 👋 Hi, I’m @ijritchey2
- 👀 I’m interested in learning code through fun projects to eventually impact my work. I want to solve the problems that cause friction in my life.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning intro python by following the 100 days of coding challenge via Udemy.com
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... not sure yet. Still finding a project that I can focus on, however I'm thinking a computer vision tracker on a webcam could be cool. 
- 📫 How to reach me ...
